Classical inheritance in Python, Prototypal inheritance in ECMAScriptECMAScript is a braces and semicolons language while Python is white-space and indent/block basedNo var keyword in Python, implicit globals in ECMAScript, both are lexically scopedClosures in Python 2.5 and lower ( re: Alex Martelli's comment ) are somewhat "limited" because the bindings are read-only, you can't access private variables like you could in ECMAScript There's no undefined in Python, exceptions are thrownImmutable list arrays in Python ( tuples )No switch statement in Python but instead you're encouraged to use a dictionary in that manner, sometimes its convenient assigning properties to lambdas and executing themECMAScript 3 does not have a yield statement, nor let expressions/statements, nor array comprehensions - however these are included in Mozilla's JS which is non-standardraise vs throw, except vs catch ( Python, JS )Native Unicode strings in ECMAScriptkeyword operators such as and, is, and not are used in PythonPython doesn't support counters such as i++Python's for loop is "smart" so you don't need to use a counter for enumerating through lists, nor do you run into prototypal properties inherited from Object.prototype You don't have to use the new operator in Python to create objectsPython is duck-typedI stole a good bit of info from http://hg.toolness.com/python-for-js-programmers/raw-file/tip/PythonForJsProgrammers.htmlShareImprove this answer

Python doesn't exactly work the same way, but Python dictionaries are similar to JavaScript associative arrays.  JavaScript objects/arrays support that cool feature where you don't need to quote (single-word) strings when creating new objects:var foo = { bar: "baz" };Accessing associative array keys in JavaScript can be done using dot notation, in addition to brace notation.  That is, these are the same:foo.bar; //returns "baz"foo["bar"]; // returns "baz"Python's anonymous function (lambda) syntax is not as flexible as JavaScript's anonymous functions.Python has, like, a standard library and stuff.  (And yes, I know about Rhino et al., but the libraries they give you are not standard.  There's no standardized way to read a file in JavaScript... that I know of.)You can run JavaScript in a browser. Python... not so much.  ;)ShareImprove this answer

JavaScript doesn't care about the looks of your code (think of all the code minimizers and what the resulting looks like)Unicode support. JavaScript is all the way unicode, GAE's Python 2.5 not so much (having Latin 1 as the default character set). So having the need to support non-latin characters can be a real PITA if your'e not sure what you are doing.ShareImprove this answer

In Javascript, braces define code blocks and spaces are ignored. Furthermore, Python has bindings for the Java API, .net, and other cool fancy libraries. Javascript is pretty limited in the library department when compared to Python, but it has some neat windowing libraries and such.ShareImprove this answer
